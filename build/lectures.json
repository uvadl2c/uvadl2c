		"desc": "Week 1-2 <br></br> This module covers the topic of geometric deep learning, touching upon all its five G's (Grids, Groups, Graphs, Geodesics, and Gauges) but with a strong focus on group equivariant deep learning. The impact that CNNs made in fields such as computer vision, computational chemistry and physics, can largely be attributed to the fact that convolutions allow for weight sharing, geometric stability, and a dramatic decrease in learnable parameters by leveraging symmetries in data and architecture design. These enabling properties arise from the equivariance property of convolutions. That is, if the input image is translated, the output of a convolution is translated accordingly, which in turn means that local information does not get lost in the neural network upon an input transformation (it is just shifted to a different location). With group equivariant deep learning we can hard-code stability and weight sharing over transformations beyond just translations. E.g., it allows for sharing of weights (representing complex patterns/representations) over poses and symmetries represented by transformations such as translation + rotation + scaling. This module is split into 4 lectures: <ul><li> Lecture 1: Regular group convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs). In this lecture we cover the basics of group convolutional NNs and show how to leverage symmetries in data and practical problems.</li>  <li>Lecture 2: Steerable G-CNNs. In this lecture we introduce a very general class of G-CNNs that allows to handle (rotational) symmetries in a flexible and powerful way. These methods are at the core of the most successful methods to handle 3D data such as atomic point clouds, but are also at the core of gauge equivariant methods that are applicable to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds (e.g. 2D shapes embedded in 3D space).</li> <li> Lecture 3: Equivariant graph NNs. Many problems in computational chemistry and computational physics are now-a-days solved via graph NNs. The SotA in these domains derive their effectives from the geometric structure and symmetries presented by the data and underlying physics. In this lecture we go over some of the state-of-the-art in geometric graph NNs, discussing several instances of the equivariant message passing paradigm. </li> <li> Lecture 4: Geometric latent space models. In this last lecture we take a step back from the group equivariance paradigm and look at what other types of geometric structure can be leveraged in neural networks. We will discuss some models that are based on non-Euclidean latent spaces and go over the required geometric tools to handle them.</li> </ul>",

In this module, we consider giving NNs a Bayesian treatment.  We start by specifying a probability distribution for each weight---p(W)---and the goal of training is to obtain the posterior distribution p(W | D), where D denotes the training data, via Bayes rule.  The Bayesian approach provides natural mechanisms for model selection, complexity control, incorporating prior knowledge, uncertainty quantification, and online learning.  Yet, Bayesian inference is computationally demanding, and much of the module will focus on scalable methods for estimating the posterior distribution.",
